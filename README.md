As we all know, the Covid19 pandemic changes the way of education, making everything online as soon as possible. Nowadays, chat apps are evolving. Today, I am introducing you to my new app, "Let's Chat" this will totally change the game by giving students a platform to interact and collaborate. This app will provide access free to all users for all its features. Through this app, students can message each other, study together, and learn a new way to share notes and stuff. But how is this possible? I am providing these significant features.

#### Chat Messenging 
- This feature allows WhatsApp like Messenging where users can create groups and have private chats to interact with each other, asking doubts by sending images, videos, and audio files, etc.( this will also help students to take breaks )

This app will help all the students interact live while studying and for people in the corporate sector for meetings, etc. My goal is to provide the user with overall access in a single packed app Rather than installing different-different apps for various purposes. Without getting lost while scrolling on Instagram, etc. here, users can manage both Social and Education more efficiently. So that's it. This is my final delta project.
Thank you üòä. Have a Great Day.
